# Multilayer-Perceptron
In artificial intelligence, more precisely in machine learning, the multilayer perceptron is a type of artificial neural network organized in several layers.
A multilayer perceptron has at least three layers: an input layer, at least one hidden layer, and an output layer.
Each layer is made up of a (potentially different) number of neurons. 
The information flows from the input layer to the output layer only: it is therefore a direct propagation network (feedforward). 
The neurons of the last layer are the outputs of the overall system.
